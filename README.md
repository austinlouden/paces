### About

Pace Calculator for Runners is an app that’s designed to do one thing well. When training for a recent marathon, I found myself constantly Googling for pace tables with finish times. I built this app so I could quickly answer the question, “if I ran at a 7:30 pace, what would my marathon time be? What about a 5K?”
